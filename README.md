# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that can lead to inaccurate results when grouping data that includes `null` or `undefined` values.  The provided `bug.js` file shows the incorrect pipeline, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

## Problem
The `$group` stage in the pipeline incorrectly handles `null` and `undefined` values in the grouping field. The `$sum` operator treats these values as 0, which distorts the aggregation results, leading to inaccurate counts.

## Solution
The solution is to use the `$ifNull` operator in the aggregation pipeline to handle `null` or `undefined` values. This ensures that these values are either excluded from the aggregation or replaced with a valid value that does not skew the results. The `$ifNull` operator can be used within the `$group` stage to check for `null` values in the grouping field and handle them appropriately.
